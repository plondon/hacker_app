        <div class="interests">I love web development. I want to learn everything I can about it. I will go above and beyond to learn as much as I can, because I love doing it. I love messing up and figuring out where I went wrong. I love that "ah-ha!" moment when NOTHING you've tried has worked, but you change one little thing and everything just falls into place and starts running like new. It's not a job for me, it's not homework, it's what I'm passionate about and what I want to learn more and more about everyday.</div>
        <div class="aboutMe">I am from New York City, born and raised. Go to Sarah Lawrence College and study economics. I spend a lot of my free time learning JavaScript and Ruby and I am developing an application that works with APIs from different news sources. This past semester I held the honor of being captain of the soccer team. When I'm not doing homework, playing soccer, or teaching myself how to code I am either working at powerHouse Arena in Dumbo as the Web Design Intern or interviewing prospective students for the Sarah Lawrence admissions department. I also have a golden retriever named Sadie that I taught to roll over. She is awesome.</div>
        <div class="hacker">I'm applying to Hacker School because I am craving more web development skills and knowledge. I want to dream in code and be fluent in it so that I may express my ideas as best as I can. I have been doing the work on my own, using TreeHouse and Codecademy as much as possible. I'm reading Learn Ruby the Hard Way by Zed Shaw for fun! I'm starting Chris Pine's Learn to Code the next chance I get. Although all of these resources are great I feel as though being involved in a community, rather than exploring this field on my own, can really benefit me and help me improve immensely. I think Hacker School provides this type of community and has great teachers to support that community. I would love the chance to learn there! Thank you for your consideration!</div>
